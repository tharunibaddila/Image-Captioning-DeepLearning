**Image Captioning Using Deep Learning**
**Overview**
This project focuses on generating descriptive captions for images using deep learning techniques. It leverages an encoder-decoder architecture with CNNs for feature extraction and LSTMs for sequence generation. The model is trained on large datasets to generate meaningful captions for various images.

**Motivation**
Image captioning bridges the gap between computer vision and natural language processing (NLP), making it useful in various applications such as:

Helping visually impaired individuals understand images.

Enhancing search engines with automated image descriptions.

Surveillance and monitoring, where images need textual descriptions.

**Features**
‚úîÔ∏è Automated image-to-text generation.
‚úîÔ∏è Uses pre-trained CNN models (VGG16, ResNet50, InceptionV3, MobileNet) for feature extraction.
‚úîÔ∏è LSTM-based decoder to generate meaningful captions.
‚úîÔ∏è Tokenization and embedding layers for handling text.
‚úîÔ∏è Supports multiple datasets like MS COCO, Flickr8k, and Flickr30k.

**Technology Stack**
Programming Language: Python

Frameworks/Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas, NLTK

Deep Learning Models: CNN (VGG16, ResNet50) + LSTM

Cloud Integration: AWS S3/Azure Storage (if applicable)

**Installation & Setup**
1. Clone the repository
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-captioning.git
cd image-captioning
2. Install dependencies
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Download pre-trained models
Ensure that you have the necessary CNN models downloaded for feature extraction.

4. Run the project
bash
Copy
Edit
python main.py --image path/to/image.jpg
How It Works
The CNN (e.g., VGG16, ResNet50) extracts image features.

The features are passed to an LSTM decoder.

The decoder generates a caption word by word.

The final caption is returned as output.

Dataset Used
MS COCO (Common Objects in Context)

Flickr8k / Flickr30k

**Challenges & Limitations**
Model performance depends on dataset quality.
May generate incorrect captions if trained on a small dataset.
Limited vocabulary affects caption diversity.

**Future Enhancements**
üöÄ Support for video captioning.
üöÄ Improve caption quality with transformers (e.g., GPT-4, BERT).
üöÄ Multilingual support for diverse datasets.
